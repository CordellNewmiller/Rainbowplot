# Rainbowplot

The rainbowplot function plots each row of a 2D array as a color on a single figure. Useful for getting a "side view" of your data. 

Please see rainbowplot.py for usage and examples. 

Python 3 version ported from my original IDL version, which is included as rainbowplot.pro.

## Examples

After loading, run 

    >>> rainbowexample()

to see an example plot.

I wrote rainbowplot because I was curious about some bleeding light in a map of Jupiter, the one on the lower left in JupS0Bled.png. To see the result, run 

    >>> plotjupiter()

with JupS0Bled.fits in the working directory.
